# Build and Release (Signed + Notarized DMG)

This project includes `scripts/build_dmg.sh` to produce a distributable macOS DMG:

- Output: `dist/Aether-<arch>.dmg` (`Aether-universal.dmg`, `Aether-arm64.dmg`, or `Aether-x86_64.dmg`)
- Default build target: universal (`arm64` + `x86_64`)
- Signs the `.app` and `.dmg`
- Notarizes and staples both (unless `--skip-notarization`)
- Generates checksum/manifest artifacts for verification publishing

## What "can run on any computer" means on macOS

For normal Gatekeeper-friendly distribution to other Macs, you need:

1. A `Developer ID Application` signing certificate
2. Apple notarization
3. Stapled notarization ticket

Without notarization/signing, users can still sometimes run the app by bypassing security prompts, but it is not a clean "works anywhere" install experience.

## What notarization is

Notarization is Apple scanning your signed app/archive for malicious content. If accepted, Apple issues a ticket. When you staple that ticket to your app/DMG, macOS can validate it offline and Gatekeeper is much less likely to block first launch.

## Prerequisites

1. macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools
2. Apple Developer Program membership (paid)
3. Installed `Developer ID Application` certificate in your keychain
4. `xcrun notarytool` credentials stored in keychain (profile name)

## Full Xcode Toolchain (for SwiftUI macro packages)

Some Swift packages (for example `HighlightSwift >= 1.1.0`) use SwiftUI macro plugins like
`@Entry` and `#Preview`. These may fail to compile if your active developer directory points to
Command Line Tools only (`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`).

To make the environment ready:

1. Install full Xcode (App Store or Apple Developer download)
2. Switch active developer directory:
   `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
3. Run first-launch setup:
   `sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch`
4. Accept Xcode license:
   `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
5. Verify toolchain:
   `xcode-select -p && xcodebuild -version && swift --version`

## Apple ID, Team ID, and certificate details

### Apple ID: can this be any email?

No. It must be the Apple Account that has access to your Apple Developer team. In practice:

- It can be any email address format only if that email is the sign-in for an Apple Account in the developer team
- For Apple ID auth with notarytool, you also need an app-specific password
- If you are in multiple teams with the same Apple ID, `--team-id` selects which team notarytool uses

### Team ID: what is it?

`TEAMID` is your Apple Developer Team identifier (usually 10 uppercase alphanumeric characters), for example `ABCDE12345`.

Use the team that owns the `Developer ID Application` certificate used to sign the app. If team/certificate/auth do not match, notarization will fail.

You can find Team ID in:

- App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Membership
- developer.apple.com -> Account -> Membership

If you are in multiple teams, use the team that issued the `Developer ID Application` certificate you pass in `APP_SIGN_IDENTITY`.

### Signing identity used by this script

Set `APP_SIGN_IDENTITY` to your certificate common name, for example:

```bash
APP_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDE12345)"
```

You can inspect available code-sign identities with:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

## Configure notarytool credentials locally

Create or update a local keychain profile (example profile name: `AETHER_NOTARY`):

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials AETHER_NOTARY \
  --apple-id "you@example.com" \
  --team-id "ABCDE12345" \
  --password "<app-specific-password>" \
  --validate
```

Notes:

- `--password` is an Apple app-specific password, not your Apple Account login password
- If you omit `--password`, `notarytool` prompts securely in terminal
- Running `store-credentials` again with the same profile name updates/replaces the saved credentials

## How to update stored credentials later

Common cases:

1. Password rotated/revoked: rerun `store-credentials` with the same profile name
2. Switched Apple ID or Team: rerun with new values under same or new profile name
3. Multiple environments: use separate profile names (for example `AETHER_NOTARY_DEV`, `AETHER_NOTARY_CI`)

A quick validity check is to submit a build; `store-credentials --validate` also performs a credential validation request.

## Build command

From repo root:

```bash
APP_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDE12345)" \
NOTARY_PROFILE="AETHER_NOTARY" \
scripts/build_dmg.sh --bundle-id "com.yourcompany.aether" --version "1.2.1" --arch universal
```

If `--version` is omitted, the script uses the latest git tag (without leading `v`) or falls back to `0.0.0`.

By default, the script sets:

- `CFBundleShortVersionString` from `APP_VERSION` (what macOS shows as `Version X.Y.Z`)
- `CFBundleVersion` from `APP_BUILD` (defaults to git short hash)
- `AetherBuildTimestamp` from current UTC time
- `AetherBuildCommit` from git short hash
- `AetherBuildTargetArch` from `--arch`
- `AetherLicense` from `LICENSE_NAME` (default `MIT License`)

So About shows `Version X.Y.Z (<build-info>)` instead of duplicating the same value twice.

## Useful script options

```bash
scripts/build_dmg.sh --help
```

- `--bundle-id <id>`: CFBundleIdentifier in `Info.plist`
- `--version <semver>`: app short/build version
- `--arch <target>`: `universal` (default), `arm64`, or `x86_64`
- `--app-only`: build/sign only `dist/Aether-<arch>.app` (no DMG/notarization)
- `--open-app`: open the resulting app bundle after build
- `--skip-notarization`: sign only, skip notary submission/stapling

Additional env var:

- `APP_BUILD`: explicit build info for `CFBundleVersion` (for example `a1b2c3d4` or CI build number)
- `TARGET_ARCH`: same as `--arch`
- `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: explicit UTC timestamp in ISO8601 format
- `BUILD_COMMIT`: explicit source marker (commit, tag, or CI revision)
- `LICENSE_NAME`: license label shown in About

## Integrity artifacts generated

For each build, the script writes:

- `dist/Aether-<arch>.dmg`
- `dist/Aether-<arch>.dmg.sha256`
- `dist/Aether-<arch>.app-executable.sha256`
- `dist/Aether-<arch>.build-manifest.json`

Recommended release publishing:

1. Publish the DMG
2. Publish the `.dmg.sha256` and `.build-manifest.json`
3. Optionally publish the executable checksum file for in-app SHA comparison

## Resource handling in the DMG build

`scripts/build_dmg.sh` includes resources from both:

- SwiftPM-generated resource bundle(s) (for `Bundle.module`, e.g. `Aether_Aether.bundle`)
- Source resources under `Sources/Aether/Resources` (copied to `Contents/Resources/AetherResources`)

It also generates `Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns` from:

- `Sources/Aether/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`

and sets `CFBundleIconFile=AppIcon` in the app `Info.plist` so Finder/Dock can use that icon.

You do not need to move `Sources/Aether/Resources` for this packaging flow.

## Local dry run (no Apple account required)

For packaging flow validation only:

```bash
APP_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" scripts/build_dmg.sh --skip-notarization
```

This uses ad-hoc signing and is not suitable for public distribution.

## Run from IntelliJ as a real `.app` bundle

`SwiftRunPackage` runs the executable directly, not from an `.app` bundle.  
That is why App-menu behavior (including About integration) can differ from installed/package builds.

Use the helper script to run the app as a bundle locally:

```bash
scripts/run_app_bundle.sh
```

This defaults to your host architecture (`arm64` on Apple Silicon, `x86_64` on Intel), builds `dist/Aether-<arch>.app`, and launches it.

To force universal:

```bash
scripts/run_app_bundle.sh --arch universal
```

IntelliJ Run Configuration (recommended):

1. Run | Edit Configurations...
2. Add New Configuration | Shell Script
3. Name: `Aether (Run App Bundle)`
4. Script path: `$PROJECT_DIR$/scripts/run_app_bundle.sh`
5. Working directory: `$PROJECT_DIR$`
6. Run

Optional env vars in that config:

- `APP_VERSION=1.2.1` (or your target version)

By default, `scripts/run_app_bundle.sh` always uses ad-hoc signing (`-`) to avoid keychain/timestamp prompts.
If you need certificate signing for local runs, pass it explicitly:

```bash
scripts/run_app_bundle.sh --sign-identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDE12345)"
```

or set:

```bash
RUN_APP_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDE12345)" scripts/run_app_bundle.sh
```

If you need to attach from another process while debugging, enable `get-task-allow` for the local app bundle:

```bash
scripts/run_app_bundle.sh --allow-debugging
```

or set:

```bash
RUN_APP_ALLOW_DEBUGGING=1 scripts/run_app_bundle.sh
```

For direct packaging script usage:

```bash
APP_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" scripts/build_dmg.sh --app-only --allow-debugging
```

This is intentionally limited to `--app-only` builds. `get-task-allow` is a local debugging entitlement and should not be used for notarized/public distribution builds.

## Verify output

After build:

```bash
ls -lh dist/Aether-*.dmg
cat dist/Aether-universal.dmg.sha256
cat dist/Aether-universal.build-manifest.json
spctl -a -vvv -t open dist/Aether-universal.dmg
```

You can also mount and inspect:

```bash
hdiutil attach dist/Aether-universal.dmg
```

## CI note

Apple ID + app-specific password works, but App Store Connect API key auth is often preferred for CI (`notarytool store-credentials --key ... --key-id ... --issuer ...`).
